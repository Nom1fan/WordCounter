WordCounter Project
==================

This is a Java project written by Mor Merhav.
Since I couldn't find an easy solution for this on the popular textual editors (MS Word, Acrobat Reader, etc.) I decided to write it myself.
This tool allows you to produce a word histogram for different textual file formats (doc, docx, pdf, txt).

Running
-------

1. Double click .jar file or run from command line: `java -jar WordCounter.jar`.
2. Click 'Browse' and select a textual file.
3. View word histogram.
